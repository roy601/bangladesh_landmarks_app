# Academic Integrity Statement

The following components were entirely created and implemented by me:

### 1. Project Planning & Design
- Application architecture and structure decisions
- Feature selection and prioritization
- User interface layout and navigation flow
- Database schema design
- Testing and debugging processes

### 2. Implementation & Integration
- Integration of all components (screens, services, providers)
- Coordination between API service, local database, and UI
- Configuration of dependencies in pubspec.yaml
- Setting up Android permissions and build configurations
- Image resize implementation and file handling logic
- State management flow using Provider pattern
- Error handling and user feedback mechanisms

## Tools & AI Assistance Used

### AI Tools
- Claude AI  - Primary development assistant

### What AI Was Used For:

1. - Initial code structure and boilerplate for Flutter screens
   - REST API service implementation patterns
   - SQLite database setup and queries
   - Provider state management structure
   - Widget layouts and UI components

2. **Debugging Assistance:**
    - Identifying causes of compilation errors
    - Suggesting solutions for runtime errors
    - Explaining error messages and stack traces
    - Helping resolve dependency conflicts

3. **Documentation:**
    - README template and structure
    - Code comment suggestions
    - Project documentation formatting

### Other Tools Used:
- **Android Studio** - IDE and development environment
- **Flutter SDK** - Framework
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control
- **Pub.dev** - Package repository for dependencies
- **OpenStreetMap** - Map tiles and services
- **Excalidraw** (planned) - Wireframe creation

### 1. Code Modifications
All AI-generated code was:
- **Reviewed** to ensure understanding
- **Modified** to fit project-specific requirements
- **Debugged** when errors occurred
- **Adapted** for OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps

### 2. Project Structure
- **AI Suggested:** Standard Flutter folder structure
- **My Implementation:** Organized files according to feature (screens, services, providers, models)

### 3. Configuration Files
- **AI Provided:** Template for pubspec.yaml, AndroidManifest.xml
- **My Modifications:**
    - Selected and added specific packages needed
    - Configured Android permissions for camera, location, storage
